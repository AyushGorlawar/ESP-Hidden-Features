#  Day 8 ‚Äì ESP8266 WiFi Beacon Spammer (Fake SSID Broadcaster)

Turn your ESP8266 into a **WiFi network illusionist** ‚Äî broadcast dozens of fake SSIDs visible on any nearby phone or laptop.  
This trick uses low-level packet injection to simulate access points without actually creating them.

---

##  What Makes It Hidden?

- Uses the rare `wifi_send_pkt_freedom()` function from the **ESP8266 SDK**
- Doesn't create real access points ‚Äî just beacon frames
- Not officially documented in Arduino core
- Works *even without hosting WiFi* ‚Äî it's pure signal manipulation

##  Legal Warning

This is **for education only**.

‚ùå Do **NOT** use in public places  
‚ùå Do **NOT** target real networks  
‚úÖ Only use in isolated or shielded environments

---

##  Hardware Required

- ‚úÖ ESP8266 Board (e.g., NodeMCU, Wemos D1 mini)
- ‚ùå ESP32 NOT SUPPORTED (as `wifi_send_pkt_freedom` is ESP8266-specific)

## Setup Instructions

1. Open Arduino IDE
2. Install ESP8266 board package
3. Enable `#include <user_interface.h>` (may require adding it manually)
4. Upload `beacon_spammer.ino`
5. Open Serial Monitor for logs

##  Customization

Change the `ssidList[]` array to broadcast your own set of names:
